# First spring records in 2024

<img src="_figures/spring_dates_2024.png" width = "750">

This plot now shows when 21 of our common spring migrant birds are most likely to first be seen in Hertfordshire and their first dates in 2024 (details of how to interpret the plot below).

With a little run of new birds, the first garden and grasshopper warblers, lesser whitethroats and hobby have now been seen.

Not many to go now! Swifts and whinchat are likely to be next over the coming week or so.

**How to interpret the plot** The vertical line within each box is the average first date for that species. The boxes and whiskers show when we'd expect to first see the species in most years. The small triangles show unusually early or late first records for that species
