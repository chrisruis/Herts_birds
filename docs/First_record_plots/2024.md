# First spring records in 2024

<img src="_figures/spring_dates_2024.png" width = "750">

This plot now shows when 21 of our common spring migrant birds are most likely to first be seen in Hertfordshire and their first dates in 2024 (details of how to interpret the plot below).

The plots starting to fill up! Common tern and common sandpipers should start to arrive in the coming days.

**How to interpret the plot** The vertical line within each box is the average first date for that species. The boxes and whiskers show when we'd expect to first see the species in most years. The small triangles show unusually early or late first records for that species
