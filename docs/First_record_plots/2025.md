# First spring records in 2025

<img src="_figures/spring_dates_2025.png" width = "750">

This plot now shows when 21 of our common spring migrant birds are most likely to first be seen in Hertfordshire and their first dates in 2025 (details of how to interpret the plot below).

As we enter March, it brings the possibility of the first sand martins and little ringed plovers, with the first wheatears unlikely to be far behind.

**How to interpret the plot** The vertical line within each box is the average first date for that species. The boxes and whiskers show when we'd expect to first see the species in most years. The small triangles show unusually early or late first records for that species
