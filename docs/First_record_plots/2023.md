# First spring records in 2023

<img src="_figures/spring_dates_2023.png" width = "750">

This year, we added two new species to the plot - whinchat and common sandpiper. So this plot now shows when 21 of our common spring migrant birds are most likely to first be seen in Hertfordshire and when they were first seen in 2023 (details of how to interpret the plot below).

2023 was remarkable in being rather predictable! Almost all of the birds turned up within their most expected range of dates. The exceptions were a slightly later than average first cuckoo record and a slightly earlier than expected first reed warbler, but these weren't early or late by much.

**How to interpret the plot** The vertical line within each box is the average first date for that species. The boxes and whiskers show when we'd expect to first see the species in most years. The small triangles show unusually early or late first records for that species
